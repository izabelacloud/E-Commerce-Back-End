## User Story 

AS A manager at an internet retail company<br />
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies<br />
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies<br />

GIVEN a functional Express.js API<br />
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file<br />
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize<br />
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands<br />
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data<br />
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application<br />
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database<br />
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags<br />
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON<br />
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia<br />
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database<br />


## Usage

The application allows to create, get, update and delete categories, products and tags and serves as a backend / baseline for an e-commerce application.
